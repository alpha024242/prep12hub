<p>The <strong>Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)</strong> has officially announced a major update for the <strong>Class 12 board exams 2026</strong>: the introduction of a digital answer evaluation system known as <strong>On-Screen Marking (OSM)</strong>. This significant reform aims to improve accuracy, transparency, and speed in the evaluation process for Class 12 answer sheets, replacing traditional manual checking. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>

<h2>What Is On-Screen Marking?</h2>
<p>Under the new system, scanned answer sheets will be evaluated by examiners on computers rather than physically. This reduces the chances of human error and accelerates result processing. Schools and teachers will be equipped to handle digital evaluation workflows by the 2026 board exam period. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>

<h2>Why It Matters to Students</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faster results:</strong> On-Screen Marking can significantly reduce evaluation time.</li>
<li><strong>More accurate scoring:</strong> Digital marking cuts down totalling and transcription errors.</li>
<li><strong>Remote evaluation:</strong> Teachers can evaluate from their schools without travel.</li>
<li><strong>Better transparency:</strong> Digital logs and checkpoints ensure consistent marking standards.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Helps You Prepare</h2>
<p>As the evaluation becomes digitized, students are advised to focus even more on the <strong>clarity of handwriting</strong> and <strong>structured answers</strong>, because their scanned responses will be digitally analyzed. Practicing clean layouts and diagrams in answers will help avoid misinterpretation by evaluators.</p>
